# Immediate Plans for the Mutual Information of NQS Project
- [x] Feel comfortable with information theory basics.
- [ ] Feel comfortable with entropy, mutual information.
- [ ] Feel comfortable with transformer basics in Julia, and also Julia itself.
- [ ] Understand how we are going to calculate the mutual information of the NQS by the transformer.
- [ ] Get the code mutualinformationestimation.jl working, modify if necessary.
- [ ] Use the sampling functions and use the wavefunctions to calculate the mutual information.

...Then, go on with the neural network parts.
