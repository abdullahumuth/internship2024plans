# Immediate Plans for the Mutual Information of NQS Project
- [x] Feel comfortable with information theory basics.
- [x] Feel comfortable with entropy, mutual information.
- [x] Feel comfortable with transformer basics in Julia, and also Julia itself.
- [x] Understand how we are going to calculate the mutual information of the NQS by the transformer. (For the discrete case)
- [ ] Understand how we are going to calculate the mutual information of the NQS by the transformer. (For the continuous case) (Not needed)
- [x] Write a transformer model to estimate the mutual information between spin states and the corresponding wave function coefficients.
- [x] Use the sampling functions and use the wavefunctions to calculate the mutual information.

...Then, go on with the neural network parts.
